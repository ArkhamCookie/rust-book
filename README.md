# The Rust Book

I'm following along with [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) and decided to upload my "work" to GitHub in case someone finds it useful.
~~ GitHub is also a good way to backup projects.~~

If you find this helpful, I recommend following along with the book yourself.
